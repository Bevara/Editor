# Bevara vscode editor

This is yet a small extension to help debugging decoders from Bevara products.

## Demo


```bash
# Install dependencies for both the extension and webview UI source code
npm run install:all

# Build webview UI source code
npm run build:webview
```

Once the sample is open inside VS Code you can run the extension by doing the following:

1. Press `F5` to open a new Extension Development Host window
2. Inside the host window, open a media file
